## Files

-revmlpipeline.py  
Includes all improved machine learning pipeline components for this assignment

-analyzedata.py  
Pyfile to run code for analyzing the donation data

-data_analysis.ipynb

## Major improvement

1. Leave the gap between train data and test data  
-Make 60days gap before test data starts

2. Process data after splitting  
-Make dummy feature variables after splitting the data

3. Calculate threshold based on the population of probability(in short report)  
-Make threshold variable according to the distribution of probability

4. Add feature  
-Add new feature(teacher prefix)

5. Combine some files and add comments
